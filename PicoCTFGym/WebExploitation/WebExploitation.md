There is a cookie in storage, not sure what it does but it has value -1

Submitting snickerdoodle will prompt That is a cookie! Not very special though...

Changing the value of the cookie from 0 to 1 will change the text from
**I love snickerdoodle cookies!** 
to
**I love chocolate chip cookies!**
Changing to 2 will give 
**I love oatmeal raisin cookies!**

Using the script made in python3 to parse through cookie values and searching for a successful return code and the keywords picoCTF to search for the flag.
